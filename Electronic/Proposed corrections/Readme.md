# Proposed corrections

This folder contains the (semi)fixed project.
We fixed the errors on CircuitMaker and exported the project again.
This was partly educational and partly so you can use it without the headaches we had.
Let's get on to it:

##WHAT WAS FIXED:

###MUX size:
The MUX was inverted and the package used was unecesseraly big. This was fixed.

###LCD pins:
LCD pins were not properly connected. Now they are.

###ATMEGA pins:
MC pins were reallocated to simplify stuff and make stuff prettier and stuff.
New positions are available in the sheet.

###Button:
Button was rotated because it was wrong before.

###L298 Ground:
Now the L298 is properly grounded. Heat dissipation is better this way.

###Servos:
Servos are now connected directly to the battery. That's how they were supposed to be.
